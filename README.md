## Getting started

Please note that before this package can be used, Firebase Core needs to be initialized in your application. See the official [FlutterFire documentation](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview#initializing-flutterfire) for up to date information.

For a complete example (with Firebase initialization) see the [example](example/) project.

Or take a look at a [live demo](https://funwithflutter.github.io/lit_firebase_example/). 

Some videos on Lit Firebase:
[Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66TKtvgjFa8)

Note that this video was recorded with the old version of FlutterFire and Lit Firebase Auth. As such, some configuration may be different. For example, this does not show how to initialize FlutterFire.

[Customizing Lit Firebase UI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpvpbQF-2Js)

## Platform Configuration

### Android integration

Follow normal [Firebase Initialization](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/installation/android)

*Note:* When you are debugging on android, use a device or AVD with Google Play services.
Otherwise you will not be able to authenticate.

### iOS integration
Follow normal [Firebase Initialization](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/installation/ios)

You will also need to define a global platform for your project. Modify the `ios/Podfile` and make sure the following is not commented out:
```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'
```
You can find this at the top of the `Podfile`.

### Web integration
Follow normal [Firebase Initialization](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/installation/web)

The above should be sufficient, and should provide up to date information. But for additional information, please see below:

You'll need to modify the `web/index.html` of your app following the Firebase setup instructions:

* [Add Firebase to your JavaScript project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#from-the-cdn).

Read more in the [`firebase_auth_web` README](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/flutterfire/blob/master/packages/firebase_auth/firebase_auth_web/README.md).

Below is an example of a Flutter Web `index.html` with Firebase Auth enabled:

```html
...
<body>

  <!-- GOOGLE SignIn Client ID -->
  <meta name="google-signin-client_id" content="ADD-YOUR-CLIENT-ID.apps.googleusercontent.com">

  <!-- The core Firebase JS SDK is always required and must be listed first -->
  <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.15.5/firebase-app.js"></script>
  <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.15.5/firebase-auth.js"></script>

  <!-- TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
     https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries -->

  <script>
    // Your web app's Firebase configuration
    var firebaseConfig = {
      ...// ADD CONFIG HERE
    };
    // Initialize Firebase
    firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
  </script>

  <!-- CONTINUE TO INITIALIZE FLUTTER WEB -->
  ...
```

## Usage
The two most important widgets are 
- `LitAuthInit` - which initializes the package and exposes the services that will be used in your application.
- `LitAuth` - which renders the UI (forms, buttons and dialogs).

### Lit Firebase Initialization
First, you need to initialize the package with `LitAuthInit`. This should be at the root of your application. Above `MaterialApp`/`CupertinoApp`, and above any widgets that want to access authentication functionality.

For example:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Needs to be above [MaterialApp]/[CupertinoApp]
    return LitAuthInit(
      // specify which auth providers to enable
      authProviders: AuthProviders(
        emailAndPassword: true, // enabled by default
        google: true,
        apple: true,
        twitter: true,
        microsoft: true,
        github: true,
        anonymous: true,
      ),
      child: MaterialApp(
        title: 'Material App',
        home: Home(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Standard Sign-in widget
You can either create your own custom sign-in widget, or make use of the standard built in one.
To use the standard sign-in form with no changes:

```dart
LitAuth();
```

This will use the default configuration and UI theming.

<p align="left"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45597490/88035376-3ee01200-cb6c-11ea-8076-782b9f424e7e.jpg" height="200" alt="Lit Firebase"></p>

See the section on [decoration and theming](#decoration-and-theming) for customization.

**NOTE**: This widget needs to be a child of a `Scaffold` widget.

### Handle auth state changes
To determine the current auth state, make use of `LitAuthState`:

```dart
class Home extends StatelessWidget {
  const Home({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: LitAuthState(
        authenticated: () => Text('Authenticated'), // Login widget, or sign in button
        unauthenticated: () => Text('Not Authenticated'), // Authenticated widget, or sign out button
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
### Auth success and failure
You can provide optional callbacks in `LitAuth` to handle success and failure when performing sign-in.

```dart
return LitAuth(
  onAuthFailure: (failure) {
    print('Auth failed.'); // show error message
  },
  onAuthSuccess: () {
    print('Auth success.'); // navigate to new screen
  },
);
```
**NOTE**: these handlers will not be called if `LitAuth` is already disposed.

For example, if you were to wrap this `LitAuth` in `LitAuthState`, such as:
```dart
return LitAuthState(
  authenticated: () =>
      Text('Authenticated'), // Login widget, or sign in button
  unauthenticated: () => LitAuth(
    onAuthFailure: (failure) {
      print('Auth failed.'); // show error message
    },
    onAuthSuccess: () {
      print('Auth success.'); // will not be called
    },
  ),
);
```
Then in this instance the `onAuthSuccess` handler may not be called. As the `authenticated` state will be triggered and the `LitAuth` widget disposed.

### Sign out
To sign out the current user, make use of the `signOut` extension method on `BuildContext`. For example:
```dart
RaisedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    context.signOut();
  },
  child: Text('Sign out'),
);
```

### Get current user
Depending on the status of the user you'll get a different state: empty, initializing, or success.

```dart
final litUser = context.getSignedInUser();
litUser.when(
  (user) => print(user.uid),
  empty: () {},
  initializing: () {},
);
```

The `value.user` is the Firebase `User` object.

### Watch user for changes
Watches the Firebase `User` object for changes. Will be triggered every time the Firebase `User` changes (for example, on logout or new sign in).
```dart
final litUser = context.watchSignedInUser();
litUser.when(
  (user) => Text('Signed in ${user.uid}'),
  empty: () => Text('Not signed in'),
  initializing: () => Text('Loading'),
);
```
The above should only be used in the build method. If you need direct access to the current user, prefer `context.getSignedInUser()`.

### Determine if submitting is active
 Whether Lit Firebase is currently attempting to authenticate. Can be used to show a loading indicator.

 Should only be used in the build method. For example:

 ```dart
 Widget build(BuildContext context) {
   final isSubmitting = context.isSubmitting();
   return Visibility(
     visible: isSubmitting,
     child: CircularProgressIndicator(),
   );
 }
 ```

## Authentication Providers

Lit Firebase Auth supports a number of third party authentication providers, such as Google, Apple, Github, etc.

### Initialization
Enable the sign-in method you want to use in firebase console 

### Google Sign In for Android

Lit Firebase Auth uses the [google_sign_in](https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in) package for Google Sign in. Please see their documentation if you encounter difficulties.

Please ensure you have done the steps outline in [Android integration](#android-integration)

The majority of the configuration is on Firebase side. First, Google Sign In needs to be enabled in the Authentication section of your Firebase project. Next, if you have not done so yet, you will need to provide your application's SHA certificate within your Firebase settings and replace the `google-services.json` file with the updated one. This is needed for Google Sign in to be allowed.

A correctly setup Firebase project and the correct `google-services.json` file is all you'll need.

### Google Sign In for iOS

Lit Firebase Auth uses the [google_sign_in](https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in) package for Google Sign in. Please see their documentation if you encounter difficulties.

Please ensure you have done the steps outline in [iOS integration](#ios-integration)

Then add the `CFBundleURLTypes` attributes below into the `[my_project]/ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.

```xml
<!-- Put me in the [my_project]/ios/Runner/Info.plist file -->
<!-- Google Sign-in Section -->
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
	<dict>
		<key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
		<string>Editor</string>
		<key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
		<array>
			<!-- TODO Replace this value: -->
			<!-- Copied from GoogleService-Info.plist key REVERSED_CLIENT_ID -->
			<string>com.googleusercontent.apps.861823949799-vc35cprkp249096uujjn0vvnmcvjppkn</string>
		</array>
	</dict>
</array>
<!-- End of the Google Sign-in Section -->
```

#### iOS additional requirement

Note that according to https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/get-started,
starting June 30, 2020, apps that use login services must also offer a "Sign in
with Apple" option when submitting to the Apple App Store.

### Google Sign in for Web

You will need to add the Google Sign in Client ID to your `index.html` file. You can get this ID from the Firebase console, within the Google Sign-in Web Configuration (Authentication section).

An example is below:

`web/index.html`
```html
...
<body>

  <!-- GOOGLE SignIn Client ID -->
  <meta name="google-signin-client_id" content="ADD-YOUR-CLIENT-ID.apps.googleusercontent.com">
...
```

### Apple Sign In for Android
This should be working, but has not been tested. There should be configuration examples in the Firebase documentation.

### Apple Sign In for iOS

1. [Configure your app](https://help.apple.com/developer-account/#/devde676e696) in Xcode to add the "Sign In with Apple" capability

### Twitter Sign In for iOS and Android
1. Register your app as a developer application in [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en)
2. Copy Paste your API Key and API Secret into the Twitter Sign In Method in Firebase
3. Enable 3rd party authentication in Twitter Developer Portal and copy past callback URL from Firebase

### Github Sign In for iOS and Android
Similar process to Twitter Sign in.

### Using with Lit Firebase Auth
The supported third-party providers are:
* Google
* Apple
* Github
* Twitter

**NOTE:** Apple requires Apple sign in to be enabled if any other third-party sign-in option is used.

These need to be enabled in the `LitAuthInit` widget.
```dart
LitAuthInit(
  // specify which auth providers to enable
  authProviders: AuthProviders(
    emailAndPassword: true, // enabled by default
    google: true,
    apple: true,
    twitter: true,
    microsoft: true,
    github: true,
    anonymous: true,
  ),
  child: MaterialApp(
    title: 'Material App',
    home: Home(),
  ),
);
```

To initiate authentication with one of these providers, call the relevant method. For example:

```dart
FlatButton(
  onPressed: () {
    context.signInWithGithub();
  },
  child: Text('Github Sign In'),
),
```

Other identity providers (for example, Facebook) will need to be implemented separately. After successful third party sign in you can sign in to Firebase by making use of the `signInWithCredential` method available on `BuildContext`.

For example:

```dart
 Widget build(BuildContext context) {
   AuthCredential credential = // get credential for identity provider (Facebook, etc.)
   context.signInWithCredential(credential);
 }
 ```

## Decoration and theming
The UI can be as customizable as you need. But for simple usage it's fairly straight forward.

It's easy to provide custom decoration/configuration for the sign-in elements. You can either customize the elements of the standard sign-in widget, or create an entirely custom sign-in widget from scratch. Up to you.

### Standard Sign-in widget customization
For example, to override the standard email `TextFormField` just provide a `TextFieldConfig` for the `emailTextField` parameter. In this example we are providing a new [style] and [inputDecoration]:

```dart
return LitAuth(
  config: AuthConfig(
    emailTextFormField: InputDecoration(labelText: 'My beautiful label'),
    emailTextField: TextFieldConfig(
      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
      inputDecoration: InputDecoration(
        labelText: 'My beautiful label',
      ),
    ),
  )
);
 ```

To customize a button:

 ```dart
return LitAuth(
  config: AuthConfig(
    signInButton: ButtonConfig.raised(
      themedata: ButtonThemeData(buttonColor: Colors.red),
      child: Text('Sign in with Email'),
    ),
    googleButton: GoogleButtonConfig.light(),
    appleButton: AppleButtonConfig.dark(),
  ),
),
 ```

There are a number of different button customizations that you can do.

### Notifications
Notifications are rendered using the [flushbar](https://pub.dev/packages/flushbar) package.

You can customize the error and success notifications:

```dart
LitAuth(
  errorNotification: NotificationConfig(backgroundColor: Colors.pink),
  successNotification: NotificationConfig(backgroundColor: Colors.pink),
);
```

There are many attributes that can be altered to create the desired notification. Please see the `NotificationConfig` class for additional information.

### Additional Customization

For further customization you can directly make use of the Lit Firebase components to build a completely custom sign-in widget.

Instead of using the standard `AuthConfig`, set it to custom and provide your custom sign-in widget:

```dart
return LitAuth.custom(
  child: YourCustomSignInWidget(),
);
```

You can build any form you want, for example:

```dart
class YourCustomSignInWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const CustomSignInWidget({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        Text('Welcome', style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4),
        // You need to wrap the custom sign-in widgets with a SignInForm.
        // This is used to validate the email and password
        SignInForm(
          formChild: Column(
            children: [
              Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                child: Text(
                  'A custom form',
                  style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline5,
                ),
              ),
              Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                child: EmailTextFormField(
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
                  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'My Email Label'),
                ),
              ),
              Padding(
                padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
                child: PasswordTextFormField(
                  style: TextStyle(fontSize: 18),
                  decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'My Password Label'),
                ),
              ),
              RaisedButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  context.signInWithEmailAndPassword();
                },
                child: Text('Sign In'),
              ),
              FlatButton(
                onPressed: () {
                  context.signInAnonymously();
                },
                child: Text('Anony Sign In'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

**NOTE**: `SignInForm` needs to be provided above the `EmailTextFormField` and `PasswordTextFormField`.

The state of the password and email can be cleared manually by calling:

```dart
context.resetSignInForm()
```

This will reset the form to its initial state.

It's a good idea to do this when you have multiple `EmailTextFormField` and `PasswordTextFormField` widgets in separate locations, for example when you have a separate Sign-in form and a Registration form.

### Icons

It's possible to use the OAuth icons provided by the package. For example:

```dart
class Icons extends StatelessWidget {
  const Icons({Key key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        LitAuthIcon.google(),
        LitAuthIcon.appleBlack(),
        LitAuthIcon.appleWhite(),
        LitAuthIcon.github(),
        LitAuthIcon.twitter(),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

This will display a column of icons (images).
